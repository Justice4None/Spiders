    <h2>This nastly little motherfucker is the most venomous spider on Earth today.</h2>
    <p>The Brazilian Wandering Spider is a disgusting spider belonging to the Ctenidae family of spiders. This is one of the few spiders who have been known to kill humans. The genus name <em>Phoneutria</em> literally means "Murderess" in Greek. These horrible creatures are found just about anywhere in central and south America, specifically the Amazon rainforest.
    </p>
    <p>The venom of the Brazilian Wandering Spider contains a potent neurotoxin. At deadly concentrations, this neurotoxin causes loss of muscle control and respiratory problems, which eventually lead to death in the victim. Another effect of the venom is (in men) that it causes erections that can last for days or weeks.</p>
    <p>The Brazilian Wandering Spider is extremely defensive, and will assume a threat posture when it feels threatened, raising its front half up to make itself look larger. It will also strike repeatedly.</p>
    <h3>Basically. Fuck this thing.</h3>
